# Patterns Starter

Use [`npm init`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-init) to [scaffold a new `@nycopportunity/pttrn` CLI project](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/patterns-cli#scaffold-command) by running either of the commands below.

```shell
$ npx @nycopportunity/create-pttrn-starter
```

or

```shell
$ npm init @nycopportunity/pttrn-starter
```

You will need to create a **package.json** file and install the `@nycopportunity/pttrn` CLI as a dependency of the project.

```shell
$ npm init -y
```

`npm init` can be run with or without the `-y` flag. Using it will skip prompt questions about contents of the file when creating it.

```shell
$ npm install @nycopportunity/pttrn
```

[Learn more about package.json files and what should go in them in the npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json).
